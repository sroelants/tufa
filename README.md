# Tufa

A simple 2-factor authentication generator.
**WARNING**: For the time being, 2FA secrets are stored as plaintext, which is 
a serious security consideration to take note of..

Left to do:
- [✓] Encrypt secrets with master password
- [✓] Actual error handling
- [✓] Confirmation prompting
- [✓] `tufa ls`
- [✓] rename to `tufa rm`
